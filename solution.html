<h2>The Multiscope Forester Planter  is equipped with a modular planting payload with a capacity of 380 seedlings. Its planting speed is around 5-6.5 hours per hectare depending on the tree species and the terrain. The system is designed for a temperate climate zone.The robotic planters are equipped with Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) which uses laser pulses to build up a three-dimensional image of the robotsâ€™ surroundings and global positioning (GPS) to navigate precisely across the terrain.</h2>
